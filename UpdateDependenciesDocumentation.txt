The Zhirong Bao Lab's software suite utilizes on a common data interface
which enables users to segment, analyze, annotate, curate and visualize their
microscopy data across all of our software. Further, this enables the applications
to interface with each other during runtime. The main example of this is the ability
to view a dataset opened in AceTree in the WormGUIDES application. To achieve this
tight coupling of software, our applications depend on one another and these
dependencies need to be updated whenever major changes are implemented. Below is
a breakdown of the dependencies across the software suite that required updates.

Program: AceTree
Dependencies: WormGUIDES

Program: Acebatch2
Dependencies: AceTree

To update these dependencies, simply add the new program build to the respective
libs/ folder and rebuild the project.

For example, if a change is made to WormGUIDES, after building the new WormGUIDES.jar
and testing it, follow these steps:
1. Navigate to your local AceTree repository in a file explorer
2. Go to the libs/ directory
3. Delete WormGUIDES.jar
4. Add the new WormGUIDES.jar to this folder
5. Rebuild AceTree jar in IntelliJ
6. Test
