Steps to setup Acebatch2 for development in IntelliJ:

0. Fork project from lab github account, clone to local machine
	a. While signed in to your github account, go to:
		https://github.com/zhirongbaolab/Acebatch2
	b. Click the 'Fork' button in the top right corner to create a 
		copy of Acebatch2 on your github account
	c. To create a copy of your newly forked Acebatch2 repo, open a
		terminal window (cmd if using Windows) and change directories
		to wherever you will maintain your project files. Then, type:
		git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Acebatch2.git
	d. Change directories into the newly cloned copy of Acebatch2 on your
		local machine:
		cd Acebatch2

If you haven't downloaded IntelliJ yet, go to: 
	https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=
	and select Windows, mac, or Linux depending on your machine

1. Create an IntelliJ project
	1a. If another project is already open in IntelliJ:
	Select File->New->Project From Existing Sources...
	1b. If looking at the IntelliJ startup screen:
	Select New Project, specify JavaFX application, and press Next

2. In the file chooser that appears, select the Acebatch2 directory that 
	you just cloned

3. In the next window, select Create project from existing sources and
	press Next

4. Make sure the Project name is 'Acebatch2', the location is correctly
	set, and the format is .idea (directory based)

5. Make sure that /path/to/dir/Acebatch2/src is shown in the next window
	as the source files for the project (it should find this
	automatically). If it doesn't appear, add the /src directory
	to this list. Press Next

6. Review the libraries found (this should also be found automatically
	and you shouldn't need to change anything). Make sure the following
	libraries appear in the left pane and then press Next:
	AceTree

7. Review the suggested module structure. The left pane should contain
	Acebatch2 and the right pane should contain the libraries selected
	in the previous step. Press Next

8. Select 1.8 as the SDK for the project and press Next (using 1.8
	of 05/19. Update accordingly)

9. Wait for frameworks detection to complete (none should be found).
	Press Finish


ADD Acebatch2.jar build routine:
Acebatch2 is packaged as a JAR application for distribution and use
within the lab. IntelliJ makes building JARs easy by setting your
build rules for your project. Follow the instructions below to set
up your Acebatch2 IntelliJ project to easily build JARs.

1. Go to File->Project Structure
2. In the left navigation panel, select Artifacts
3. Press the + in the top left portion of the window
4. Select JAR->From modules with dependencies...
5. Make the following selections in the resulting window
	5a. Ensure Acebatch2 is set in the Module field
	5b. Press the small folder on the right side of the
		Main Class field and select:
		 Acebatch2
		Press OK
	5c. Select extract to the target JAR
	5d. Directory for META-INF/MANIFEST.MF should be:
		/path/to/dir/Acebatch2/src
		** NOTE: if a MANIFEST.MF already exists there,
					delete the whole folder first and
					then start at step 1
		Press OK
6. Back in the Project Structure window, update the 
	Output Directory field at the top of the window to:
	/path/to/dir/Acebatch2
	This will ensure that the resulting JAR is built in the 
	top level of the Acebatch2 directory, where it has been
	typically located
7. Press Apply to save the changes, and OK to close the window


Build Acebatch2 JAR:
1. Select Build->Build Artifacts... (from the top navigation bar)
2. In the small window that appears, select:
 Acebatch2:jar->Build to start the build routine

A status bar should appear on the bottom of the IntelliJ window which
will indicate when building is done. To trace output of the project,
run the JAR from a terminal by typing:
java -jar Acebatch2.jar COMMAND_LINE_ARGUMENTS (if in Acebatch2 directory already)
