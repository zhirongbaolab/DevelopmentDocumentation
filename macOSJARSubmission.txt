Instructions for preparing JAR for submission to the macOS store

0. If your machine doesn't have a JDK installed, install JDK 1.8

1. Use the javapackager tool from Oracle to convert a JAR into a macOS .app

Change directories to the top level of the WormGUIDES repository

$JAVA_HOME/bin/javapackager -deploy -srcdir src/ -srcfiles WormGUIDES.jar -outdir . -outfile WormGUIDES -appclass start.MainApp -native -name WormGUIDES

(Note: the command line arguments for the above command may differ for this JavaFX app.
These were found from a guide for a java Swing application, so they may differ slightly
for WormGUIDES)

2. Open XCode and follow the steps in the following guide to submit the newly
created WormGUIDES.app to the macOS store:
